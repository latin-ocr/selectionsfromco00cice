INTRODUCTION. I 3

8. Style of the letters. — Some of the letters were
expected by the writer to become public property, and
were formal in tone and studied in diction; but the
great mass have the charm of spontaneity and are
written in the language of conversation, the sermo fa-
wiliaris or cottidianus (XXXII). Among the chief
stylistic peculiarities of the letters are: (a) the fre-
quent use of Greek words and phraseS, especially as
technical terms or to make the letter unintelligible to
those who might tamper with it, but also in some
measure, perhapS, an affectation, although it should be
noted that most of the Greek occurs in letters to Atti-
ωε, who sic Graece loquebatur ut Athenis uatus videre-
tmf(Nep. Att. 4. 1); (b) the prevalence and variety of
diminutive formations3 (c) the freedom of composition
with per and snb. (d) Here should be mentioned, t00,
the epistolary tenses The Roman letter writer trans-
ferred himself to the time of receipt or of reading of
his letter, and used the imperfect to describe that which
was happening at the time of writing, the pluperfect to
describe that which had happened previous to the time
of writing (cf. profecti sumus, pelcbamns, XIII. 18, 193
putares, XXVII. 13 sperabam, audiebam, XXXVIII.

45, 46)-
