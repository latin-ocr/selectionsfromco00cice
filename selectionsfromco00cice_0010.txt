4 PREFACE.

interesting as to tempt the reader on, the language
should oppose a 'minimum of hindrance, and the style
should heighten the allurement of the theme by its
perspicuity and vivacity. Nothing in Roman literature
meets these requirements so nearly as do many of the
letters of Cicero Almost all were intended for the
eye of the correspondent alone, and not for publica-
tion, and were accordingly, for the most part, genuine
in sentiment and easy in diction. They are *one of our
chief sources for the history of the final years of the
RepubliC, and put us on intimate terms with the men
of that momentous time. We owe it to them that we
know Cicero himself from all points of view better than
any other man of ancient Rome. More important, how-
ever, than their historical and autobiographical value is
the familiar account they give us of Roman character
and of Roman life.

It is believed that with the help given in the foot-
notes the letters of the present selection will not prove
difficult to students who have begun the reading of
Cicero, and that they will be found to have sufficient
interest to justify their use as late as the first years of
the'college course. The text is based in the main on
the recensions of Mendelssohn‚ Wesenberg, and O. E.

Schmidt.
It remains for me to acknowledge the generous assist-

ance rendered by Prof. A. P. Hall of Drury College,
Mr. G. Β. Rogers of the Phillips Exeter Academy, and
Mr. Glanville Terrell of Harvard College in the reading

of proof.
