INTRODUCTION. Ι Ι

The earliest of the extant letters is Aet. Ι. 5, written
in B.c. 68, in Cicero’s thirty-ninth year, and the latest
Fam. 10. 24, dated July 28th of the last year of his life.
There are no letters for the eventful year of Cicero's
consulship. The letters to Atticus are arranged chrono-
logically, but not without mistakes in order; those of
the collection ad Fam, roughly by correspondents,

could not well have appeared before his death, a year

correspondence, addressed to him who was destined
to be its editor. This was Tiro, his freedman, secre-
tary, and friend. The editorship of the Epist. ad Att.
is, however, disputed, many scholars holding that the
collection must have been made by Atticus. The chief
support of this view is derived from the fact that no
letters from Atticus appear in the collection (as none
from Tiro appear in the Epist. ad Fam), although his
letters were preserved by Cicero, as we learn from Att.
9. 10. 4. We know, moreover, that Atticus was one of
Cicero's publishers The title ad Fam. does not occur
in any mention of the letters in antiquity, and is inexact,
since many letters to Cicero are included in the collec-
tion, and many of the correspondents were not famili-
