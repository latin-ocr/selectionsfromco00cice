Si vales, bene est. Existimaram prc‘) mutue inter nes

plied, and to have remained at
Rome for three years, for there are
extant no letters ad Att. dating from
the time of this one to the Kalends
of January, 61 B.C.

ΙΙΙ. written in January, 62 B.C.
Q. Metellus Celer was praetor 63
B.C. and rendered valuable assist-
ance in the suppression of the con·
spiracy of Catiline. WVhen Cicero
relinquished Macedonia to Antonius,
it became necessary that one of the
praetors should be given a consular
province, and Cicero seems to have
contrived that this province, Cisal·
pine Gaul, should fall to Metellus.
The brother of Metellus Celer, Q.
Metellus Nepos, in his capacity of
tribune had forbidden Cicero to
make a farewell address to the
people on laying down the consul-

 

ship, on the ground that he had
put citizens to death unheard, and
had continued to attack him. Cicero
finally replied in ,a sarcastic speech,
which is not extant, and it isv to this
speech that our letter refers. Q. F.
(greeting), Quinti filius. PrOCOS.
(greeting): Metellus, although he
had not yet held the consulship,
was administering a consular prov-
ince, i.e. a province in which a
military force was stationed. 2. ab·
sentem, se. me. 3. capite, civil
rzglcls. 6. vos, you and your politi-
[αἰ friends ,· notice the changes of
number. 8. squalore, a sign of
mourning, but the word is not here
to be understood literally. Moum-
ing was worn among the Romans
by those whom disgrace threatened.
10. ratione, in a reasonable way.
