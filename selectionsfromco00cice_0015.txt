INTRODUCTION. 9

5. 1 we are told of a letter which was brought from
Rome to Athens (sane strenue) in twenty-one dayS,
while in Fam. 16. 21. 1 the tabellarii are said to have
taken forty-six days for the same journey. The person
into whose hands the letter was given was frequently
not trustworthy, and when important, it was sometimes
sent in duplicate by different messengers (uno or eodem
exemplo). In VI. we find mention of the loss of a
letter on the road. In view of the fact that letters
might be tampered with (V. 8-11), the meaning was
often disguised, where the subject was a delicate one,
by the use of covert language.

4. The form of the letter.—A Pompeian wall paint-
ing represents a sealed letter addressed M. Lucretio
Flamini Αἴαντές Decurz'onz' Pompeis, and in Att. 8. 5. 2
Cicero gives the direction of a package as simply M'.
Cario. The Roman letter had date and place of writing
at the end, and in this order. The name of the place
stood in either the ablative or the locative (XII., XIII.,
XXVIII„ XXXIX„ XLII., L., LIV.) It will be
notieed that both date and place are generally omitted,
and that the date is sometimes given without the place.
The reason for the invariable omission of the date in
the ease of letters of introduction is obvious, The sig-
nature was not subscribed as with us, but the name of
the writer stood at the beginning of the letter in the
nominative, with the name of the person addressed in
the dative, as subject and object respectively of the
phrase of salutation, salutem dicit (SD). This was
sometimes amplified to salutem plurimam dz'cz't(S.P.D.)‚
