10 INTRODUCTION.

sometimes shortened to salntem (Sal. or 5.), and some-
times omitted altogether. The formality of the greet-
ing varied with the intimacy of the correspondents
We find the praenomen alone (XIV), cognomen alone
(XX L), praenomen and cognomen, praenomen and nomen
(XXXVIII.)‚ and all three (IV.) A very formal greet-
ing contained, as in the last example, the fulllnames of
both persons with their titleS, if they held office, and the
praenomina of their fatherS‚ sometimes of their grand-
fathers also. In correspondenee with members of his
own household, Cicero used less regular forms (X1119,
XXVIII.) The greeting was sometimes followed by
stereotyped expressions of interest in the health and wel-
fare of the person addressed (HL, IV.‚ XLV.‚ XLVIII.‚
L.). There was greater variety in the forms of affec-
tionate or considerate farewell; cf. Cnra nt valeas
(XII.), Cnra nt valeas et me, nt amm, ama (XXL),
Vale (XXXV.)

5. The collections of Cicero's letters. —Of the letters
of Cicero's correspondence there have come down to
us nearly nine hundred in all, of which about four hun-
dred are Epistulae ad Atticum, a somewhat larger num-
ber Epistnlae ad Familiares so called, and the remainder
ad Quintum Fratrem and ad Brutum. The greater col-
lections are divided into sixteen books each, the Epist.
ad Quint. Erat. into three, and the Epist. aa' Brnt. into
two. Nearly one hundred of the letters are from other
than Cieero’s hand3 among the writers are Cato, D.
BrutUS, M. BrutuS‚ CassiuS‚ Pompey, Caesar, Asinius
Pollio, Lepidus, and other famous men of the time.
