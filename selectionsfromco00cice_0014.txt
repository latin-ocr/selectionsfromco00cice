8 INTRODUCTION.

2. Ancient paper. ——We know that many of Cicero's
letters were written on the tablets described above, but
for the longer letters paper (charta) made from the
papyrus plant was used. Pliny the Elder is our chief
authority for the manufacture of the chartae. The pith
of the reed was cut into thin strips3 these were laid
side by side, and covered transversely witha similar
layer. They were then wet with water, and perhaps
with paste‚ pressed or hammered into a single sheet,
and made smooth by polishing. The size of the charta
depended upon the distance between successive joints
of the papyrus reed. For writing on this substance, a
pen (calamus) of reed, very like the quill pen of modern
times, was used. The ink (atramentmn) was made of
soot and gum, or from the juice of the cuttle-fish, and
was thick like the ink of the Chinese. It could be
removed with a sponge (spongia), and the charla thus
cleaned was called a palz'mpsestztS. In Fam. 7. 18. 2
Cicero asks Trebatius what writing could have been so
worthless as to be replaced by the latter's letter.

3. The transmission of letters—There was no gov-
ernrnent post in the time of Cicer0‚ and the letter writer
had to depend for the delivery of his letters upon mes-
sengers (tabellarii) in his service or in the service of a
friend, the messengers of the farmers of taxes (publi-
cani), the orderlies (statores) of the officials of the prov-
inceS, or the kindness of those who happened to be
going in the right direction. The messengers covered
from thirty-five to forty-five miles a day on land, and
by sea, from five to seven knots an hour. In Fam. 14.
